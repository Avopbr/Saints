## Pitch
We are team Saints. 

Our challenge was to identify and solve a problem in our community. We had to geolocation in our solution.


We met up with Xolani who is a coach of the local Under 10's team. He was worried because the team's games were being poorly attended. He pointed out that he suspected the low turnout was due to the poor advertising on his side. He also pointed out that he could not afford ever increasing costs of printing fliers. 
We asked Xolani to give us some time while we worked on a solution.

We then met Mazwi who is a local Hip-Hop Dj. Just like Xolani, he felt more could be done on getting the word out. He told us he recently lost a lot of money after he booked a Dj from the Eastern Cape only to have a poor turnout.
We asked Mazwi to give us some time while we worked on a solution.

## Realization
###We came to a realisation that a lot of important events were being poorly attended due to lack of advertising. The events ranged from talent shows, comedy shows and sometimes special events in which international dignitaries spoke on matters of international importantance.

Our Solution

We knew that advertising could solve the problems faced by Mazwi and Xolani. With the set of skills that we have acquired at Codex we went straight into action. 

The App
The app uses geolocation to find were the user is. It then queries the database to find the events nearest to the user. We believe this will help those that might want to promote their events online. The app sustains itself through adverts. 
The administrator(Team Saints) updates all the the events. All events self destroy as their date passes ensuring the user always gets relevant and up to date events.
Future of the App
In the future we would like to add some more features to the app.
Ability to get directions to the events
Ability to sort events by distance and date

We would also like to work on feedback & suggestions that we get from the users.
